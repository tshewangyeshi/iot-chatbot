Overview
 











Maximizing energy efficiency while maintaining optimal working conditions is essential in modern manufacturing environments. Smart HVAC and Lighting Systems use IoT-enabled sensors, automation, and analytics to regulate temperature, airflow, and lighting levels in real-time, adjusting dynamically to operational needs. These systems help manufacturers reduce energy consumption, lower operating costs, and improve worker comfort and safety. By integrating environmental data with building controls, they enable predictive maintenance and adaptive responses that minimize waste. Our solutions are designed to meet the rigorous demands of industrial settings, delivering reliable performance and seamless integration. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, IoT Manufacturing Tech supports a wide B2B customer base across North America, driving innovation and helping businesses unlock scalable smart building efficiencies. 









The Following are Our Advanced IoT Offerings for Smart HVAC and Lighting Systems
 



In addition to offering products and systems developed by our own team and trusted partners for Smart HVAC and Lighting Systems, we are proud to carry top-tier technologies from GAO (Global Advanced Operations) Tek Inc. and GAO (Global Advanced Operations) RFID Inc. These reliable, high-quality products and systems enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive IoT technologies, integrations, and services you can trust. Where relevant, we have provided direct links to select products and systems from GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc .
