Overview
 











									Real-time visibility into the supply chain is essential for maintaining efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing decision-making in manufacturing operations. IoT-based Supply Chain Visibility Systems leverage advanced IoT sensors, data analytics, and cloud technologies to provide continuous monitoring of goods and assets throughout the entire supply chain. These solutions empower manufacturers and logistics providers to track inventory movements, environmental conditions, and operational status instantly, enabling proactive responses to potential disruptions. In today’s fast-paced manufacturing environment, such real-time insights are more critical than ever for staying competitive. Serving a growing B2B customer base across North America, we at IoT Manufacturing Tech have quickly established ourselves as a trusted leader by delivering reliable, scalable IoT solutions from our headquarters in Chicago, IL.								









The Following are Our Advanced IoT Offerings for Supply Chain Visibility Systems
 



In addition to offering products and systems developed by our own team and trusted partners for Supply Chain Visibility Systems, we are proud to carry top-tier technologies from GAO (Global Advanced Operations) Tek Inc. and GAO (Global Advanced Operations) RFID Inc. These reliable, high-quality products and systems enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive IoT technologies, integrations, and services you can trust. Where relevant, we have provided direct links to select products and systems from GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc . 






Core Components  
















Hardware 



GPS IoT Trackers/Devices provide real-time location and movement tracking of shipments, containers, and mobile assets across the supply chain.UHF RFID Readers, Tags & Accessories enable automated tracking of goods at checkpoints such as warehouses, loading docks, and transit hubs.Cellular IoT Devices ensure continuous transmission of logistics data from moving vehicles and remote distribution points without relying on fixed infrastructure.BLE Gateways, Beacons & Accessories monitor in-transit conditions such as tilt, shock, and proximity to ensure safe handling of sensitive goods.LoRaWAN Gateways relay long-range sensor data from transport or warehouse environments to centralized visibility platforms in real time.Device Edge enables real-time processing of location, condition, and status data directly at handover or transit nodes, ensuring fast visibility updates. 








Software 



Centralized inventory tracking and supply chain management platformsAdvanced analytics dashboards offering real-time insights and historical trendsMobile applications for on-site and remote managementERP and warehouse management system (WMS) connectors for seamless integrationAutomated workflow and alert configuration toolsData visualization and reporting modules
