Smart Asset Tracking to Maximize Equipment Efficiency 



Monitor, locate, and optimize critical assets in real time with our IoT-based Asset Tracking and Utilization Systems. 






Read More













Overview
 











IoT-based Asset Tracking and Utilization Systems empower manufacturers to gain real-time visibility into the location, status, and usage of critical physical assets across facilities. These intelligent systems eliminate manual tracking, reduce asset loss, and enable data-driven decision-making that improves operational efficiency. By integrating sensors, cloud connectivity, and advanced analytics, they help optimize equipment utilization, maintenance schedules, and overall asset lifecycle management.At IoT Manufacturing Tech, we develop smart asset tracking systems designed to meet the evolving demands of industrial operations. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, we serve clients across North America with scalable IoT solutions backed by innovation, reliability, and unmatched customer service. Our mission is to help B2B customers streamline asset management and unlock the full value of connected factory infrastructure. 









The Following are Our Advanced IoT Offerings for Asset tracking and utilization systems
 



In addition to offering products and systems developed by our own and other partners, we are proud to carry top-tier products and systems from our trusted partners, GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc., delivering reliable, high-quality technologies, integration and services you can count on. When appropriate, we have provided links to relevant products and systems of GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc . 






Core Components  
















Hardware 



UHF RFID Readers, Tags & Accessories enable rapid, bulk identification and location tracking of tools, parts, and containers across manufacturing zones.GPS IoT Trackers/Devices provide real-time location visibility for mobile equipment such as forklifts, generators, or modular machinery on large industrial sites.Proximity & Presence Sensors monitor the presence and motion of high-value assets in defined zones to prevent misuse or misplacement.Wi-Fi HaLow End Devices offer low-power connectivity for asset-mounted sensors transmitting status and utilization data over expansive factory layouts.BLE Gateways, Beacons & Accessories create localized geofences and motion triggers, enabling fine-grained usage logging and zone-level asset visibility. 








Software 



Real-time asset tracking dashboardUtilization analytics and historical usage reportsAutomated maintenance scheduling engineConfigurable alert and notification system 





Cloud Services 



Secure cloud-based asset databaseIntegration APIs for ERP/CMMS systemsScalable storage for large asset fleetsRemote access through web and mobile apps

Case Studies 














U.S. Case Study – Aerospace Manufacturer, Seattle, WAA large aerospace firm implemented our IoT-based tracking solution to monitor tools and parts across multiple hangars. By integrating RFID tags and BLE beacons with their existing ERP, they achieved a 40% reduction in search time for assets and significantly improved audit compliance. 





U.S. Case Study – Oilfield Equipment Supplier, Houston, TXWe helped an oilfield equipment provider track high-value machinery across storage yards and remote drilling sites. With GPS and geofencing features, the company eliminated unauthorized equipment transfers and cut asset recovery time by over 50%. 





Canadian Case Study – Food Distribution Hub, OntarioA distribution center managing perishable inventory turned to IoT Manufacturing Tech to track the movement and usage of refrigeration units and pallet jacks. Using our mobile-accessible dashboard, they optimized asset allocation, reducing equipment idle time by 30% and improving on-time deliveries.
