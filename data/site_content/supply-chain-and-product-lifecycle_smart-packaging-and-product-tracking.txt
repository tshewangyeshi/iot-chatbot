Overview
 











									Manufacturers and distributors are transforming how they monitor goods throughout the supply chain by embedding sensors and communication devices directly into packaging. Smart packaging and product tracking systems powered by IoT technologies provide real-time data on location, environmental conditions, and tampering events, delivering continuous actionable intelligence. This approach enhances product safety, reduces losses, and ensures compliance with regulatory standards. Businesses benefit by optimizing inventory management and improving customer satisfaction through greater transparency and trust in product provenance. With a growing B2B presence across North America, IoT Manufacturing Tech combines technology innovation and dependable service to empower clients with smart, scalable IoT solutions. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, we pride ourselves on supporting the manufacturing industry with reliable and cutting-edge product tracking technologies.								









The Following are Our Advanced IoT Offerings for Smart Packaging and Product Tracking 



In addition to offering products and systems developed by our own team and trusted partners for Smart Packaging and Product Tracking, we are proud to carry top-tier technologies from GAO (Global Advanced Operations) Tek Inc. and GAO (Global Advanced Operations) RFID Inc. These reliable, high-quality products and systems enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive IoT technologies, integrations, and services you can trust. Where relevant, we have provided direct links to select products and systems from GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc .
