Overview
 











Manufacturers today are under constant pressure to reduce energy costs, improve sustainability, and maintain operational efficiency. That’s why more industrial businesses are turning to advanced digital platforms that offer real-time control and insight. IoT-based Energy Management Systems empower manufacturers with the tools needed to monitor, analyze, and control energy consumption across facilities, processes, and equipment. These systems transform raw energy data into actionable intelligence, enabling users to identify inefficiencies, optimize equipment usage, and automate adjustments on the fly. At IoT Manufacturing Tech, we provide scalable, cloud-enabled platforms designed to integrate seamlessly into industrial environments. Serving B2B clients across North America, our focus on real-time visibility, data accuracy, and secure connectivity helps drive smarter energy strategies. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, we’re committed to delivering reliable, innovative solutions tailored for energy-intensive operations. 









The Following are Our Advanced IoT Offerings for Energy Management Systems 
 



In addition to offering products and systems developed by our own team and trusted partners for Energy Management Systems, we are proud to carry top-tier technologies from GAO (Global Advanced Operations) Tek Inc. and GAO (Global Advanced Operations) RFID Inc. These reliable, high-quality products and systems enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive IoT technologies, integrations, and services you can trust. Where relevant, we have provided direct links to select products and systems from GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc . 






Core Components

Relevant U.S. & Canadian Industry Standards
 



U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Industrial Energy Efficiency StandardsISO 50001:2018 – Energy Management SystemsANSI/ASHRAE 90.1 – Energy Standard for BuildingsENERGY STAR for IndustryCSA C837 Series – Canadian Smart Metering and Energy Monitoring Standards 











Case Studies 














U.S. (Michigan Automotive Plant)An automotive manufacturer in Detroit deployed IoT Manufacturing Tech’s energy management platform across its stamping and assembly lines. Within six months, the plant reduced its peak demand charges by 22% and improved baseline energy efficiency by 18%, leading to over $400,000 in annual energy savings. 





U.S. (Texas Electronics Facility)A Texas-based electronics manufacturer utilized our smart sensors and real-time analytics to monitor HVAC energy use in cleanrooms. By integrating our solution with their building management system, the company achieved a 27% reduction in energy waste and met ISO 50001 certification within the first year. 





Canada (Ontario Food Processing Plant)A food manufacturer in Ontario used IoT Manufacturing Tech’s cloud-based monitoring tools to identify high-consumption bottlenecks in refrigeration and steam systems. By implementing predictive energy controls, the plant cut energy costs by 16% while aligning with CSA C837 and ENERGY STAR targets.
