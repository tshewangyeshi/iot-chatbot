Overview 











Managing waste streams and emissions is critical for sustainable manufacturing and regulatory compliance. Waste and Emissions Monitoring systems leverage IoT technology to provide real-time data on pollutant levels, waste generation, and disposal processes. These systems continuously measure air and water emissions, track hazardous waste, and detect anomalies to ensure timely intervention. By integrating advanced sensors, analytics software, and cloud connectivity, manufacturers gain actionable insights that help reduce environmental impact, optimize resource use, and avoid costly violations. Our solutions are designed to meet the high standards of industrial environments, enhancing operational transparency and environmental responsibility. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, IoT Manufacturing Tech serves a growing B2B client base throughout North America, driving innovation with reliable products and customer-focused support. 









The Following are Our Advanced IoT Offerings for Waste and Emissions Monitoring 
 



In addition to offering products and systems developed by our own team and trusted partners for Waste and Emissions Monitoring, we are proud to carry top-tier technologies from GAO (Global Advanced Operations) Tek Inc. and GAO (Global Advanced Operations) RFID Inc. These reliable, high-quality products and systems enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive IoT technologies, integrations, and services you can trust. Where relevant, we have provided direct links to select products and systems from GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc . 






Core Components  
















Hardware 



LoRaWAN End Devices transmit emissions and waste monitoring data over long distances with minimal power consumption, ideal for dispersed monitoring points.BLE Gateways, Beacons & Accessories collect and forward localized waste handling and air quality data in enclosed or indoor areas.Device Edge processes emissions and waste data on-site for immediate regulatory alerts, reporting, and operational adjustments.NB-IoT End Devices support long-range, low-power connectivity for emission and effluent monitoring systems in isolated or underground infrastructure. 








Software 



Real-time emissions and waste analytics dashboardsAI-powered anomaly detection and predictive alertsRegulatory compliance reporting toolsCustomizable notification and escalation workflowsHistorical data visualization and trend analysisMobile monitoring and remote system management
