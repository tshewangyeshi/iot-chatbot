Get in Touch













Overview 











Transparency, agility, and intelligence across the supply chain and product lifecycle are now fundamental to success in modern manufacturing. Powerful IoT solutions drive this transformation by enabling real-time visibility, coordinated logistics, and data-driven decision-making from raw material sourcing through to end-of-life recycling. These technologies streamline operations, support regulatory compliance, optimize asset utilization, and elevate customer experience. With a growing B2B presence throughout North America, IoT Manufacturing Tech delivers the smart infrastructure needed to achieve these outcomesenhancing everything from inventory and fleet management to product tracking and lifecycle optimization. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, IoT Manufacturing Tech has earned its reputation as a trusted leader in IoT manufacturing innovation through continuous research, rigorous product development, and unwavering customer support. 









The Following are Our Advanced IoT Offerings for Supply Chain & Product Lifecycle
 



In addition to offering products and systems developed by our own team and trusted partners for Supply Chain & Product Lifecycle, we are proud to carry top-tier technologies from GAO (Global Advanced Operations) Tek Inc. and GAO (Global Advanced Operations) RFID Inc. These reliable, high-quality products and systems enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive IoT technologies, integrations, and services you can trust. Where relevant, we have provided direct links to select products and systems from GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc . 











							Smart Inventory Management Systems						


						Our IoT-powered inventory management systems offer real-time visibility into stock levels, warehouse conditions, and material usage. These systems reduce shrinkage, prevent stockouts, and optimize replenishment cycles. Using RFID, BLE, and smart sensors, manufacturers gain actionable insights into material flow across multiple sites and warehouse environments.
