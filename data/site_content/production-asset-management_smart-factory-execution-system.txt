Overview
 











IoT-based Smart Factory Execution Systems enable manufacturers to automate, orchestrate, and monitor every layer of the production process in real time. These systems bridge the gap between the physical factory floor and digital operations by connecting machines, systems, and people. With features like real-time process visibility, automated work order execution, and performance analytics, they empower factories to boost productivity, reduce errors, and make data-driven decisions with precision and speed.At IoT Manufacturing Tech, headquartered in Chicago, IL, we build intelligent factory execution systems designed for today’s fast-paced industrial environments. Known for our innovation, reliability, and client-focused service, we help B2B clients across North America achieve agile, cost-effective, and future-ready production operations through our advanced IoT solutions. 









The Following are Our Advanced IoT Offerings for Smart factory execution system 



In addition to offering products and systems developed by our own and other partners, we are proud to carry top-tier products and systems from our trusted partners, GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc., delivering reliable, high-quality technologies, integration and services you can count on. When appropriate, we have provided links to relevant products and systems of GAO Tek Inc. and GAO RFID Inc . 






Core Components  
















Hardware 



Proximity & Presence Sensors detect operator and equipment interaction in real time, enabling dynamic task triggering and safety checks on the factory floor.Z-Wave End Devices provide wireless control and feedback of actuators, conveyors, and indicators, facilitating decentralized execution of production commands.NFC & HF RFID Readers, Tags & Accessories authenticate personnel and track material handoffs at workstations, ensuring traceable execution steps.Wi-Fi HaLow Gateways/Routers connect distributed factory assets to the execution system backbone with reliable coverage in complex indoor environments.BLE Gateways, Beacons & Accessories enable real-time worker and asset location tracking to optimize workflow routing and execution monitoring.Zigbee End Devices automate status updates from machines and tools, directly feeding operational feedback into MES layers.

Case Studies 














U.S. Case Study – Electronics Manufacturer, Austin, TXAn electronics assembler needed real-time control over its mixed-model production lines. IoT Manufacturing Tech deployed a smart factory execution system that provided full traceability, live dashboards, and dynamic task allocation. Within three months, the company saw a 25% improvement in throughput and a 30% reduction in quality-related rework. 





U.S. Case Study – Packaging Facility, Minneapolis, MNA food packaging plant used our system to digitize manual scheduling, track machine availability, and automate quality inspections. Downtime decreased by 18%, and production line changeovers became 40% faster due to dynamic job scheduling features. 





Canadian Case Study – Machinery Producer, British ColumbiaFaced with disconnected legacy systems, a manufacturer of industrial equipment turned to IoT Manufacturing Tech for a unified execution solution. Our platform enabled end-to-end visibility and control, reducing order cycle time by 22% and increasing production accuracy by 28%.
